# FLOW

We don't necesarly want to connect to frontend and backend right away

## Step 1:

- ERD building / Mockup building / Data structure building
- Work on the components (HTML) (STATIC)

## Step 2:

- Database helpers / Routes (API all the time!)
- Component start to work with props/states using mock data

## Step 3:

- Connect backend/frontend
- Replace api route mock data with database helpers

## Step 4:

- Polishing, optimizing, refactoring
